# Building-Kmean-using-Numpy-only
This a python code to run Kmean to do the classification
In gerenal, this code include the elbow analysis by defining the value k. If you set k at 5, means that the algorithm will run k =2, k =3 , k=4 and k=5. The algorithm will finally plot the elbow plot to show the best k.
